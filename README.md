# astar_algorithm
Basic implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

The user first sets the desired start-point, end-point, as well as barriers. Using the A* algorithm, the program searches for the shortest/ most-efficient path from a given start-point to a given end-point, while avoiding barriers on the grid. Built using Pygame. 
I will most likely be making more improvements in the future besides basic functionality!

Turquoise square: starting point\
Orange square: ending point\
Black squares: barriers\
Green squares: shortest path
