# astar_algorithm
Basic implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

The user first sets the desired start-point, end-point, as well as barriers. Using the A* algorithm, the program searches for the shortest/ most-efficient path from a given start-point to a given end-point, while avoiding barriers on the grid. 

Turquoise square: starting point
Orange square: ending point
Black squares: barriers
Green squares: shortest path


I built this using Pygame, and will most likely be making more improvements in the future besides basic functionality.
