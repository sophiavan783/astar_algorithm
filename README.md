# astar_algorithm
Basic implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

The user first sets the desired start-point, end-point, as well as barriers. Using the A* algorithm, the program searches for the shortest/ most-efficient path from a given start-point to a given end-point, while avoiding barriers on the grid.
